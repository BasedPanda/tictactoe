# tictactoe
code for a quick tictactoe game

This program defines several functions that work together to implement a simple game of tic-tac-toe.

The print_board function takes a list representing the current state of the board and prints it to the console.

The get_move function prompts the current player to enter a move and returns the position on the board where they want to place their marker.

The check_win function checks the current state of the board to see if any player has won the game.

The play_game function sets up the game, alternating turns between two players until one of them wins or the board is full.
